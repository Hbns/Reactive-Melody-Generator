# Higher-Order reactive Programs

Haai -> Bytecode -> Haai Vm in Elixir




---

# A Cluster Programming Environment

- BEAM (Bogdanâ€™s Erlang Abstract Machine)
- Haai virtual machine, programmed in Elixir
- Pizilla, Raspberry Pi cluster

---

# Haai, a pure reactive programming language

- This is not a Embedded Domain Specific Language, eg: no lifting.
- Push-based, Haai updates signals in a glitch-free manner.
- Always loop, get new data in sources, cascade of signal updates to reach the sinks.

---

# Edge computing scenario

- Sensors producing a stream of data.
- Haai reaktors to handle those streams.
- Distrbute the reaktors over a cluster.

---

# A cluster of Haai virtual machines

- One manager node to manage all others.
- each node runs the Haai vm and is ready to receive a reaktor.
- Reaktors run independent from each other.
