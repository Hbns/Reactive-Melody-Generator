Dear thesis students,

The first round of thesis presentations will be happening in the following weeks. You will find important information below, as well as the schedule at the end of this mail.

Content of the presentation
For this presentation, the focus should be on putting your thesis into context (In which domain is your research? Provide background information that is necessary to understand what you are doing) on explaining your problem statement (What problem are you trying to solve?), what you have done so far as well as what are your current directions.

Format of the presentation
Each student is expected to present approximately 15 minutes, followed by up to 15 minutes of questions and comments. There is no slide limit, but the time limit will be quite strict, so make sure you can get through your slides in time. It is advised you discuss your presentation with your supervisor(s) beforehand.

If you have content that doesn't fit in your presentation, but for which you do expect questions, consider making 'backup slides' which you put at the end of the presentation. Those slides can then aid you in answering the questions.

Location and attendance
The presentations are organized in multiple sessions. To encourage questions and discussions, you are expected to be there for
the entire time slot in which you are presenting (e.g., if you present Friday at 10:30, but other students else present at 10:00 and at 11:00 on the same day, you should attend their presentation as well), unless you are genuinely unavailable.

We will organize these presentations physically at SOFT, in room 10F729.
